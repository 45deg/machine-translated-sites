# Machine translated Websites

List of URLs of unofficially machine-translated websites.

## Scope of curations

The target websites are ones that **unofficially** retrieve and translate contents from other websites (e.g. StackOverflow, Quora) **with/without** the sources.
Note that they do not include officially machine-translated documents (MSDN, Matlab Documents, etc.)

Currently, websites translated into Japanese are mainly collected.

## Format
